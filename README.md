## Why?

The job of a software developer is hard and often too serious. You always have to be productive and effective. But sometimes you need to take the time to just be a nerd 🤓 or to just have fun again. This theme is exactly for such times! Such nerdy times need to be celebrated accordingly 🎉🦄

## Installation 

Unfortunately, the current installation is a bit complicated. 
A hassle-free installation is already in development. 
Until then, the following steps must be performed to install the theme:

1. Install this theme  
2. Install [Custom CSS and JS Loader](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=be5invis.vscode-custom-css) vscode extension
3. Link the CSS file from this extension in your .vscode/settings.json: 

```
On Mac it might look something like the snippet below:

{
  "vscode_custom_css.imports": [
    "file:///Users/{your username}/.vscode/extensions/thecodemonkey.synthwave-x-fluoromachine-epic-animations-1.4.13/synthwave-x-fluoromachine.css",
    "file:///Users/{your username}/.vscode/extensions/thecodemonkey.synthwave-x-fluoromachine-epic-animations-1.4.13/epic-80s-transitions.css"
    ]
}

Windows might resemble:

{
  "vscode_custom_css.imports": [
    "file:///C:/Users/{your username}/.vscode/extensions/thecodemonkey.synthwave-x-fluoromachine-epic-animations-1.4.13/synthwave-x-fluoromachine.css",
    "file:///C:/Users/{your username}/.vscode/extensions/thecodemonkey.synthwave-x-fluoromachine-epic-animations-1.4.13/epic-80s-transitions.css"
    ]
}
```

4. `epic-80s-transitions.css` is optional and brings crazy 80's animations into your VS code!
5. From the command panel, select `Reload Custom CSS and JS`. You'll need to run this command every time vscode updates.
